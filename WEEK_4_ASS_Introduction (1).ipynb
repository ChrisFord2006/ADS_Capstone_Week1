This GDP/GSP value also makes the global top ten GDP list if Western Australia where a seperate country. Western Australia's political stability, attractive Mediterranean type climate of hot summers and mild wet winters and a labour shortage makes the Capital City Perth a desirable location to move too in search of opportunity. Perth's isolation and low population density has also helped control the spread of COVID-19. Apart from the ocassional short lockdown, lifestyle is more or less back to the normal pre 2020 level.\n\n### [Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth) has one of the lowest population densities of any of the major cities in the World and is spread out along the Indian Ocean Coast from Dawesville to Yanchep, a distance of 121 Km ([Haversine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)). The road transportation network is now well developed and personal automobiles is the prefered mode of transport. There are suburban rail and bus networks. The rail network is mainly used for workers commuting to the CBD. There are continuing developments in these areas including a rail link to Perth International airport.\n\n### The rapid growth of Perth and Western Australia since the discovery of iron ore in the Pilbra in the 1950s has resulted in considerable opportunity not only in the mining industry but throughout the state. Western Australia is also a significant gold and agricultural producer and is one of the great grain growing areas of the World. The hazards and the remote locations of most of the mines has produced a \"fly in fly out\" FIFO culture which is very well paid. I have personally heard people who have worked and are working in the mining industry boasting of pay off their family home morgages in 3 years? The rapid growth of the surburbs have resulted in the shortage of amneties and hence opportunities for business. For, example when I was living in Aveley in 2011 I could only find one petrol station in the entire Ellenbrook/Aveley/TheVines area; these suburbs have a combined  population of over 60000.\n\n### The methodology to provide information that businesses, contactors, and employees can use to make decisions uses a combination of suburb geolocation data, venue information using the foursquare API, a machine learning algorithm K-means clustering for clustering similar suburbs with similar venues and attributes, and median house price data for randomly selected suburbs. A multiple linear regression analysis will attempt to build a model to predict house median house price (dependant variable) in suburbs using two independant varibales, distance from CBD, and distance from the coast. The geolocation data will be used to calculate the distances using the Haversine calculation. This will explained in more detail in the next section.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data Analysis and Methodolgy\n\n### [The data analysis is almost completed](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/4ab6da18-3ff7-4a30-b1d8-606c65c4b63c/view?access_token=feee730b11c31c52b528d8a0ad607a4d2ecb764c49c49a959008ea464f126c51)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### The geolocation data was obtained from https://www.corra.com.au/australian-postcode-location-data/ and has the following information\n\n### |postcode|\tsuburb\t                            | state|\t  dc\t                    |type\t                                                        | lat\t          | lon            |\n\n### This data was then wrangled in Excel to create a file of only the perth suburbs and uploaded to the IBM cloud Watson Studio site and converted into an Pandas data frame in a Python 3.7 Jupyter Notebook.
